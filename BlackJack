//In blackJack: The cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Kings, queens, and jacks are each worth 10, and aces may be used as either 1 or 11. The object for the player is to draw cards totaling closer to 21, without going over, than the dealer's cards. The best total of all is a two-card 21, or a blackjack.
//What I would have to do is create an array for the value of the card. Also I would have to create another array for the type of card (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, & Spades). I would need to pull two or more random cards to see who's sum is of either 21 or lower.
